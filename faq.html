    <h1>Help / FAQ</h1>

    <h2>Where is my cashback?</h2>
    <p>Cashback from some retailers may take up to 90 days to appear. This is common across cashback platforms, as retailers often verify returns and payment confirmations before confirming rewards.</p>

    <h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
    <p>Click "Sign Up" from the homepage or app login screen, enter your email and a secure password, then follow the steps to register your account.</p>

    <h2>How do I update my profile?</h2>
    <p>Go to the Profile tab in the app, where you can update your name and email. Remember to save your changes by tapping the Save Profile button.</p>

    <h2>What are the loyalty tiers?</h2>
    <p>We offer three tiers based on your total cashback earned:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bronze – £0 to £49 earned</li>
      <li>Silver – £50 to £199 earned</li>
      <li>Gold – £200+ earned</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your tier may give you future rewards or perks as we expand the platform.</p>

    <h2>Why does Cashtraq charge a fee?</h2>
    <p>We charge a small fee because we are bringing together multiple cashback platforms into one easy-to-use dashboard. Instead of logging in to various apps, you can view, track, and optimise your earnings from one place.</p>

    <h2>Why is it worth paying the fee?</h2>
    <p>Every year, millions in cashback go unclaimed simply because people forget to log in to multiple apps or don’t know where their earnings are. Cashtraq helps you keep on top of it all — saving you time and helping you claim what you're owed.</p>
