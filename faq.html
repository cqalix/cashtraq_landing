  <h2>Where is my cashback?</h2>
  <p>Cashback can take time to appear depending on the retailer. Most track within 72 hours, but some retailers take several weeks — even up to 90 days — to confirm transactions. This delay is common across cashback platforms. If it’s been more than 90 days and it's still missing, feel free to contact us.</p>

  <h2>Why hasn’t my cashback tracked?</h2>
  <p>Cashback tracking may fail due to ad blockers, cookies being disabled, or if you didn’t click directly through Cashtraq to the retailer. In some cases, it may take several weeks for the retailer to report the transaction — this is completely normal for some merchants.</p>

  <h2>How long does cashback take to confirm?</h2>
  <p>Cashback needs to be confirmed by the retailer before you can withdraw it. This can take anywhere from a few days to 3 months, depending on the merchant and return policies. Once confirmed, you’ll see it reflected in your dashboard.</p>

  <h2>How do loyalty tiers work?</h2>
  <p>We currently offer Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers based on the total cashback you’ve earned. The more cashback you accumulate, the higher your tier and future potential perks.</p>

  <h2>Why is there a fee to use Cashtraq?</h2>
  <p>We charge a small fee to help consolidate cashback from multiple platforms into one app, saving you time and effort tracking them independently.</p>

  <h2>Why consolidate cashback in one app?</h2>
  <p>Studies show many people lose out on cashback because they forget to check multiple apps or get locked out. Cashtraq helps you avoid this by keeping everything in one place.</p>

  <h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
  <p>Simply use your email and a password to register. We recommend using a valid email address so you can access important notifications and recover your account if needed.</p>

  <h2>I can’t log in – what should I do?</h2>
  <p>Try resetting your password. If you still can’t log in, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cashtraq.co.uk">support@cashtraq.co.uk</a> and we’ll help you regain access.</p>

  <h2>Why is profile information important?</h2>
  <p>Your profile ensures we can track cashback accurately and communicate essential updates. You can update your details in the Profile tab at any time.</p>

  <h2>Is my data secure?</h2>
  <p>Yes, we use standard encryption and secure storage practices to keep your information safe. We never sell your data to third parties.</p>
