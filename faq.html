    <h2>Where is my cashback?</h2>
    <p>Cashback can take time to appear depending on the retailer. Most track within 72 hours, but some retailers take several weeks â€” even up to 90 days â€” to confirm transactions. This delay is common across cashback platforms. If itâ€™s been more than 90 days and it's still missing, feel free to contact us.</p>

    <h2>Why hasnâ€™t my cashback tracked?</h2>
    <p>Cashback tracking may fail due to ad blockers, cookies being disabled, or if you didnâ€™t click directly through Cashtraq to the retailer. In some cases, it may take several weeks for the retailer to report the transaction â€” this is completely normal for some merchants.</p>

    <h2>How long does cashback take to confirm?</h2>
    <p>Cashback needs to be confirmed by the retailer before you can withdraw it. This can take anywhere from a few days to 3 months, depending on the merchant and return policies. Once confirmed, youâ€™ll see it reflected in your dashboard.</p>

    <h2>How do loyalty tiers work?</h2>
    <p>We currently offer Bronze, Silver, and Gold tiers based on the total cashback youâ€™ve earned. The more cashback you accumulate, the higher your tier and future potential perks.</p>

    <h2>Why is there a fee to use Cashtraq?</h2>
    <p>We charge a small fee to help consolidate cashback from multiple platforms into one app, saving you time and effort tracking them independently.</p>

    <h2>Why consolidate cashback in one app?</h2>
    <p>Studies show many people lose out on cashback because they forget to check multiple apps or get locked out. Cashtraq helps you avoid this by keeping everything in one place.</p>

    <h2>How do I sign up?</h2>
    <p>Simply use your email and a password to register. We recommend using a valid email address so you can access important notifications and recover your account if needed.</p>

    <h2>I canâ€™t log in â€“ what should I do?</h2>
    <p>Try resetting your password. If you still canâ€™t log in, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@cashtraq.co.uk">support@cashtraq.co.uk</a> and weâ€™ll help you regain access.</p>

    <h2>Why is profile information important?</h2>
    <p>Your profile ensures we can track cashback accurately and communicate essential updates. You can update your details in the Profile tab at any time.</p>

    <h2>Is my data secure?</h2>
    <p>Yes, we use standard encryption and secure storage practices to keep your information safe. We never sell your data to third parties.</p>
